# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So they’ve requested a report to be created that includes the cryptocurrencies currently on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the new investment. It will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models, and since there is no known output for what we are looking for, it is decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. We’ll use data visualizations to share relevant findings with the board of Accountability Accounting.
